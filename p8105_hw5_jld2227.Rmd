```

### Problem 1

```{r data_import}
#Download and extract source data from zip archive.
download.file(url = "http://p8105.com/data/hw5_data.zip", 
              destfile =  "hw5_data.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "hw5_data.zip", exdir = "data", junkpaths = T) #extract the files into this new directory
study_csvs <- list.files(path = "data",pattern = "^.[A-z]*.*\\.csv$", full.names = T) #grab just the real CSVs beginning with a letter and ending with a .csv, avoiding unimportant files in the archive.
study_data <- study_csvs   %>%  #Creates a dataframe from the columns.
   map_df(.f = read_csv)
```

Instructions: Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary
Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.
